    ‚òê Need to come up with a better overall vision of navigation
        - Study how the react-native-redux app works with it, and mimic it with the react-navigation
        - Also check out how the react-navigation with redux integration app works and consider that
        - Seems like there should be a good way of using it with redux by utilizing actions/dispatch to navigate around with a reducer
